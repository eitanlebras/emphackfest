            <p class="impact-body">
                When it rains, the water flows over the ground, picking up pollutants such as oil, pesticides, and trash. This polluted water flows into storm drains, which in turn lead to nearby streams and rivers. This means that the polluted water can negatively affect salmon by contaminating their habitats, reducing the quality of their water, and impacting their food sources. By recognizing this relationship, we can work to minimize our effects and make a difference for salmon.

            <p class="impact-body">
                This website is intended to help you recognize how your community affects this issue and what you can do to help. By entering your address, you will be able to see how the water flows from your area to the nearby salmon habitats and understand the effects of stormwater runoff in your community. Together, we can make a difference for our local salmon and our waterways.            </p>

                SalmonShield was built by a team of students passionate about environmental data, salmon conservation, and making science accessible to everyone. We combined geospatial analysis, open government datasets, and machine learning to give anyone a window into the ecological footprint of their neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p class="team-body" style="margin-top:12px;">
                The team brings together backgrounds in software engineering, environmental science, data analysis, and design — united by a shared belief that local action starts with local awareness.
